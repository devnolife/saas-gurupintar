// No changes are needed as the existing code is assumed to be correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables without providing context or code snippets to fix them.  Without the original code, it's impossible to determine the correct fix. The updates suggest a potential issue with variable scope or missing imports, but more information is required to address them.
