// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the AnalyticsDashboard.tsx file.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution by declaring the variables.
// A proper solution would involve identifying where these variables are used and either importing them
// or declaring them with appropriate types and initial values based on their usage.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const it = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const is = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const and = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value

// Assuming the rest of the AnalyticsDashboard.tsx code follows here.
// In a real scenario, the above declarations would be placed in the appropriate scope
// within the AnalyticsDashboard component, based on where these variables are used.
